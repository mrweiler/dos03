# <small> What we did last week... </small>

----

We looked at projects <br>
for mass collaboration

----

Then we looked at the <br>
preregistration process <br>
and registered reports

----

And we talked about tools <br>
for digital open scientists

----

Any questions or anything to add?

# <small>Last week's homework</small>

----

Who of you could take a look at  <br>
the experiments and surveys at <br>
<a href="https://expfactory.github.io/expfactory/">The Experiment Factory</a>?

----

Who found something interesting?

----

Who did not?

----

Any questions about <br>
the experiment factory?

## <small>Scientific pitfalls</small>

- Where do you see room for "problems"?  
- What kind of problems?  
- Please discuss with your neighbors.

## <small>Low statistical power</small>

- $\alpha$: The conditional probability of incorrectly <br>
  rejecting H0 when it actually is true.
- $\beta$: The conditional probability of failing <br>
  to reject H0 when it is false.
- Power: The complement of β (i.e. 1 - β), this is the <br>
  probability of correctly rejecting H0 when it is false.

## <small>A 21 word solution</small>  
“We report how we determined our <br>
sample size, all data exclusions <br>
(if any), all manipulations, and <br>
all measures in the study.”
